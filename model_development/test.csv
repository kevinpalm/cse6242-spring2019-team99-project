Are you using spaces or tabs to indent? If you are using tabs and have not changed the settings to insert spaces instead of tabs, that could be a reason why you are having problems.
In your first screenshot, a possible reason for the first error is you NEED to place an expression under the else. The second error is due to indentation. Just as mstellaluna said.

The nested if statements won't work. Well, the second if statement never gets executed.

```
if a > 0:
    print(""pos"")
    if a < 0:
        print(""neg"")
```
if a is less than zero, it will never print ""neg"". The reason is that a first needs to be greater than zero for it to reach the second if statement. And unless it gets changed along the way (which in this example it never does) it won't hit that second if statement.
