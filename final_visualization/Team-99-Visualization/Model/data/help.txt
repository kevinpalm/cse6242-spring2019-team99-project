{ "Text" : "Using the Charts\n\nBubble Chart:\n\nThe user may enable and disable topics by clicking on the appropriate topic under the Active Topics on the left.\nThe user may zoom in using the pan slider, or they may zoom in using the mouse wheel.\nThe user may pan by clicking and dragging.\nThe user may resize the bubbles if they are too small or too large after zooming.\nMousing over a bubble will display information about user activity during that time step in the gray rectangular area above the bubble chart.\nMousing over the topic on the under the Active Topics list will display the most common words associated with that topic in the gray rectangular area above the bubble chart.\nClicking on a bubble associated with a particular topic will open up the detail graph for that particular topic on the right.\n\nFor example, if the user wanted to look more closely at some of the less active topics, she may disable the larger topics, zooom in, and then resize the bubbles to get a clearer view of the activity occuring at that smaller scale.\n\nDetail View:\n\nThe user may choose to view either messages statistics, user statistics, or both simultaneously by clicking the corresponding button under View Options.\nHovering the mouse over a topic bubblefor the currently activated topic will cause the associated bars on the graph to be highlighted.\n\nTime Options:\n\nThe user may change the granularity of the time steps by selecting Week, Two Weeks, Month, or Quarter from the options along the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe user may step backward or forward in time.\n\nThe user may animate the bubble chart by clicking play.\n\nThe user may click and drage the time slider to go directly to a particular date in the sequence.\n\nInterpreting the Charts\n\nThe chart on the left displays the relative popularity of different topics to one another over time.  The larger the bubble, the more activity took place during the time period which that bubble represents.  Each color represents its own topic.  The chart is organized as follows:\n\n- x-Axis: The cumulative number of messages that are associated with that topic.\n- y-Axis: The cumulative number of users that are associated with that topic.\n- bubble-width: The number of messages associated with that topic during that time step.\n- bubble-height: The number of users associated with that topic during that time step.\n\nThe angle at which a topic trends up and to the right indicates the average number of messages that a single user tends to post under that topic.  If the line is more vertical, then there are more users and fewer messages, and thus each user posts fewer messages overall.  Conversely, if the line is more horizontal, there are fewer users and more messages, and thus each user tends to post more messages overall.\n\nWhile the bubble chart displays the relative popularity of different topics in relationship with one another, the detail graph on the right displays the activity over time for a single topic. This chart makes it easy to see when spikes in activity occur for that particular topic." }
